<h1>Spain</h1>
	<p> I was lucky to spend so much time in Spain!</p>
	
	<p> After I graduated from high school I took a year off to travel. The travelling entailed most of the western European countries but one I liked a lot was Spain. Oppisite to my Costa Rica adventure I stayed in hostels in every country and they were way better than I ever imagined they would be. It's a very cheap option for a bed and a bathroom the only stuff you really need!</p>
