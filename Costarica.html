<h1>Costa Rica</h1>
	<p> Costa Rica, known for its monkeys and sloths!</p>
	
	<p> Costa Rica was a trip I took this past Summer with my extended family. Every year we take a trip with them and this has really been my favorite. This was one of my "luxury" vacations because I got to stay in a villa just my family and I! We saw so many sloths and monkeys and did fun activities like ziplining, hiking, and surfing!</p>
