<h1>Greece</h1>
	<p> Out of all the places I have ever been, Greece is the most beautiful!!</p>
	
	<p> I was fortunate enough to go on this trip two years ago when I had just graduated high school. My school offered this trip as an activity for any students interested so my friends and I saved up our money and signed up for the trip! </p>
